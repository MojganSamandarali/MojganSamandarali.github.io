I’m a data analyst with a Ph.D. in Economics and over five years of research experience in academia, where I specialized in quantitative and qualitative analysis, policy evaluation, and data-driven insights. My work has been driven by a passion for translating complex data into actionable solutions, and now, I’m excited to bring this expertise to the industry.

In academia, I developed expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization, along with a range of tools including Python, R, SQL, and various machine learning techniques. I’m now focused on transitioning to the industry to apply my analytical skills in real-world business contexts, helping organizations make data-informed decisions and uncover strategic insights.

Whether it’s managing large datasets, developing predictive models, or communicating insights to stakeholders, I’m ready to leverage my academic foundation in data science to tackle new challenges and contribute to impactful projects in data analytics.
